First, I like freedom, Linux is respecting your freedom. But Windows don't. For example, you can't change taskbar position in Windows 11. That's very iconic.

Second, I like bash scripting, bash works best with Linux.

Third, I like privacy. But Windows is not respecting my privacy.

I hate Windows, but I love Microsoft. :)
